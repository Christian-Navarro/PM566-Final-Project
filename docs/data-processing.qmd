# Data Acquisition

Describe where you got the data and how you downloaded it.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
# This is how I downloaded the data. I'm using eval: false so it doesn't run.
# data <- read.csv("https://some-website.com/data.csv")
```

# Data Cleaning

Show the steps you took to clean the data.

```{r}
#| echo: true
# Load the cleaned data (which you've saved locally)
# cleaned_data <- readRDS("cleaned_data.rds")

# Show the structure
# str(cleaned_data)

# Show a summary
# summary(cleaned_data)
```

# Exploratory Data Analysis

This is where you put all your exploratory plots (the ones that didn't make it into the final report).

```{r}
#| echo: true
# Exploratory histogram
# ggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = my_variable)) + geom_histogram()
```
