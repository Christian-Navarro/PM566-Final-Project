    "text": "The idea of owning a home is a cornerstone of the American Dream. However, for a growing number of Americans, that dream feels increasingly out of reach. Headlines routinely highlight skyrocketing home prices in cities like San Francisco and Austin, but is this a national crisis or a localized problem? This report moves beyond the anecdotes to analyze the data.\nOur central question is: How has housing affordability changed for median-income households in major U.S. metropolitan areas over the last decade, and what are the primary drivers of this change?\nWe will explore how the relationship between income, home prices, and rents has shifted since 2015, identifying which cities have become opportunity zones and which have become unattainable for the typical worker."
